      <h2>Hi, I'm Mercede.</h2>
      <p>I'm a healthcare coordinator during the day and an emerging Full-stack Developer by night, located in New York. In the past, I have gained experience as a graphic designer working with both print and digital media. Over time, I began to immerse myself more in the realm of web development. I am currently studying Software Engineering at Fullstack Academy.</p>
      <p>When I am offline, I am either watching unboxing videos, diving in DIY arts and crafts, or traveling. I recently picked up a new hobby: collecting blind box figurines.</p>
